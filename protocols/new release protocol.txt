      (with appropriate version x.y.z). 

   b) Make sure the zip file is named PhysiCell_V.x.y.z.zip (based on version x.y.z)

   c) Make sure the zip file excludes .git, .gitignore, and .github (and .travis.yml)

      all operating systems. 

   g) Edit the README.md file (on SF) to exclude it from stats tracking. 

10) GitHub release: 

   a) Go to https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/releases
      Click "Draft a new release"
