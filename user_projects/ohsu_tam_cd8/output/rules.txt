Cell Hypothesis Rules

In tumor cells:
oxygen increases cycle entry
pressure decreases cycle entry
oxygen decreases necrosis
damage increases apoptosis
dead increases debris secretion
IFN-gamma decreases migration speed

In M0 macrophage cells:
contact with dead cell increases transform to M1 macrophage
contact with dead cell decreases migration speed
dead increases debris secretion

In M1 macrophage cells:
contact with dead cell decreases migration speed
oxygen decreases transform to M2 macrophage
IFN-gamma increases cycle entry
IFN-gamma increases phagocytose dead cell
dead increases debris secretion

In M2 macrophage cells:
contact with dead cell decreases migration speed
IFN-gamma decreases cycle entry
IFN-gamma increases phagocytose dead cell
dead increases debris secretion

In naive T cell cells:
IL-10 decreases transform to CD8 T cell
IFN-gamma increases transform to CD8 T cell
dead increases debris secretion

In CD8 T cell cells:
IFN-gamma increases cycle entry
IL-10 decreases attack tumor
IL-10 decreases migration speed
contact with tumor decreases migration speed
IL-10 increases transform to exhausted T cell
dead increases debris secretion

In exhausted T cell cells:
dead increases debris secretion
