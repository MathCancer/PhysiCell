# PhysiCell: an Open Source Physics-Based Cell Simulator for 3-D Multicellular Systems. 

**Version:**      1.4.1
**Release date:** 2 October 2018 

## Overview: 
PhysiCell is a flexible open source framework for building agent-based multicellular models in 3-D tissue environments.

### Key makefile rules:

make               : compiles the current project. If no 
                     project has been defined, it first 
                     populates the cancer heterogeneity 2D 
                     sample project and compiles it 
   
make <project-name>: populates the indicated sample project. 
                     Use "make" to compile it. 

  <project_name> choices:
    template2D 
    template3D
    biorobots-sample
    cancer-biorobots-sample
    heterogeneity-sample
    cancer-immune-sample 

make clean         : removes all .o files and the executable, so that the next "make" recompiles the entire project 

make data-cleanup  : clears out all simulation data 

make reset         : de-populates the sample project and returns to the original PhysiCell state. Use this when switching to a new PhysiCell sample project.

## Release summary: 
 
This release improves includes minor bug fixes ... 

**NOTE:** OSX users must now define PHYSICELL_CPP system variable. See the documentation.
 
### Major new features and changes:

+ None 

### Minor new features and changes: 
 
+ Changed the MultiCellDS outputs to only store the filename, and not the full relative path, in the <filename> tags. This makes it simpler to load MultiCellDS outputs from matlab and other platforms. (No longer need to read from a directory higher up to make the relative pathing correct.) 

+ Did major cleanup on BioFVM so that it compiles cleanly on Ubuntu. 

+ All sample projects output to the ./output directory 
 
### Beta features (not fully supported):
 
+ None 
  
### Bugfixes: 

+ Updated the Parameter<T> constructor functions to create a specialized version for std::string, to fix odd compiling bugs on older versions of MinGW. (Worked in 7.1.0, but not in 5.3.0.) Now, Parameter<T> for T = bool, int, or double get initialized to value = (T) 0. And Parameter<T> for T = std::string gets initialized to "none". I had hoped to do a unified version, but value = (T) 0 for std::string acts like a NULL pointer. 

+ All Makefiles ensure that the reset and data-cleanup rules leave at least empty.txt in ./output, so that future releases are never missing the output directory. 
  
### Notices for intended changes that may affect backwards compatibility:
 
+ We intend to merge Custom_Variable and Custom_Vector_Variable in the very near future.  

+ We may change the role of operator() and operator[] in Custom_Variable to more closely mirror the functionality in Parameters<T>. 

### Planned future improvements: 
 
+ Further XML-based simulation setup. 
 
+ read saved simulation states (as MultiCellDS digital snapshots)
 
+ "mainline" prototype cell attach/detach mechanics as standard models (currently in the biorobots and immune examples)
 
+ integrate SBML-encoded systems of ODEs as custom data and functions for molecular-scale modeling 
  
+ integrate Boolean network support from PhysiBoSS into the mainline code (See http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty766. )
  
+ Develop contact-based cell-cell interactions. (Likely in next release.)

+ Add cell differentiation functionality to Phenotype, to be executed during cell division events. 
 
+ Add a new standard phenotype function that uses mechanobiology, where high pressure can arrest cycle progression. (See https://twitter.com/MathCancer/status/1022555441518338048.) 
 
+ Add module for standardized pharmacodynamics, as prototyped in the nanobio project. (See https://nanohub.org/resources/pc4nanobio.) 
 
+ create an angiogenesis sample project 
 
+ create a small library of angiogenesis and vascularization codes as an optional standard module in ./modules (but not as a core component)

+ (optionally) track internalized substrate, coupled with BioFVM
