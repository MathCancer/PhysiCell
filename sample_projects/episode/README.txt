# episode ~ PhysiCell sample project

All this sample project does is running consecutive episodes of a PhysiCell
model in one runtime.

You simply cannot learn if you have to destroy the runtime after each episode
to reset to the initial condition because you will at the same time erase
everything you learned from this episode.

We are currently working on a PhysiCell model that does reinforcement learning.
The episode sample project figures as a template project for similar
implementations and as a unit test for the necessary features.
