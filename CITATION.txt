If you use PhysiCell in your project, please cite PhysiCell and the version 
number, such as below:                                                      
                                                                             
We implemented and solved the model using PhysiCell (Version 1.7.1) [1].

    DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991                                       
                                                                            
Because PhysiCell extensively uses BioFVM, we suggest you also cite BioFVM  
    as below:                                                               
                                                                             
We implemented and solved the model using PhysiCell (Version 1.7.1) [1],    
with BioFVM [2] to solve the transport equations.
